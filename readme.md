This is the website of Glasgow Juggling Club

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites 

You will need to install node : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Installing

Once you have cloned the repository to your local machine you will need to do the following:

Install the required node modules, execute the following command in the website folder.

```
npm install
```

Build the scss files located in the sass folder into a single css file in the styles folder.

```
npm run build:sass
```

To learn more about sass you can find out more here: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax

If you're using VS Code then you can now use the live server feature to serve the site and view it in a browser.

### Updating the CSS

Run the sass watch command which will cause the style.css file to be regenerated when any of the scss files are changed.
